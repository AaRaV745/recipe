The name of this recipe, which comes from Mary Randolph’s The Virginia House-Wife, can be misleading, as it contains no chocolate. Instead, it is a very crisp, thin cookie, cut in strips that are to be dipped in Chocolate Cream. Randolph provided a guideline for presenting the cakes: “[P]ut them in the plate in rows to checker each other, and serve them to eat with chocolate.” Randolph’s directions call for making the little cakes on a griddle. For ease of preparation, oven-baking directions by culinary historian Nancy Carter Crump are provided here.
